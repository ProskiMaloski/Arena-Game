# Arena-Game
A small arena-fighter game ive been making using python. Not particularly advanced by any standard, but its a bit of fun im having.
Furthermore I'm hoping to further build upon its core for my school project. Planning to use pygame to implement graphics, but I will do this when A) Im happy with the core back-end logic
          B) My school has pygame successfully installed
